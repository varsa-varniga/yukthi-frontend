          AI-based disease detection in organic farming uses machine learning
          and image analysis to identify early symptoms in crops. This helps
          farmers act quickly, reducing losses and maintaining organic
          standards.
          <br />
          <br />
          By analyzing leaf patterns, color changes, and environmental data, AI
          models predict diseases before they spread. This supports timely
          intervention using eco-friendly methods, vital for sustainable and
          organic farming practices.
          <br />
          <br />
          Integrating AI tools with mobile apps empowers farmers with real-time
          insights. This tech-driven approach minimizes chemical use, promotes
          crop health, and enhances productivity while preserving the integrity
          of organic farming systems.
